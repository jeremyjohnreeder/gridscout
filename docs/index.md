GridScout™ is the console-based map-search tool that you didn't know you
needed. It can help you make better use of your paper maps. Without it, the
process of finding and marking places of interest is tedious. Let GridScout™
solve that so you can get on with your duty of planning for the impending
apocalypse, or whatever it is that you do.

# Suggested workflow
1. Order [waterproof paper maps][mytopo] of your areas of interest. Have them
printed with an MGRS (aka USNG) or UTM grid.
2. Get some [clear plastic overlays][duralar].
3. Search for points of interest by category: "power plants", "tank farms",
"distribution centers", etc.
4. Select individual results to see aerial and street-level views as needed.
5. Edit the GridScout™ search log (log/gridscout.log), removing any irrelevant
search results.
6. Using either the search log or the console output as a reference, plot
points on the overlays.
7. File the search log away for future reference.

# What, no GUI?
For its primary purpose of bulk collection of MGRS coordinates, simple text
output works well. But GridScout™ does integrate with
[Gmap4][gmap4] to give aerial views in your web browser. From there, you can
access other online resources such as topographic and street-level views.
Strictly speaking, however, these are not part of GridScout™.

# Seriously, paper maps?
Going into battle dependent on vulnerable infrastructure is unwise. So yes,
actual printed maps and overlays are advantageous. They work independently of
power and communication grids. They're durable, highly portable, and
low-maintenance. Fancy technology has its place, but printed maps excel in the
field. With GridScout™, you can apply the technology without the
vulnerabilities. That is, it puts your computer and the Internet to good use
now, and it helps you record on more durable media the information that you'll
need later.

# Why MGRS coordinates?
The [Military Grid Reference System][mgrs] is a whole-world variant of the
UTM coordinate system. It's used by NATO militaries because it's concise,
minimizes distortion, and makes for easy math. Latitude and longitude are
greatly lacking in these qualities. Map vendors such as [MyTopo][mytopo] allow
you to have your maps printed with a UTM grid, and for the aforementioned
reasons I suggest that you take them up on that option.

# How do I get GridScout™?
It's on [GitHub][github], and it's free!

# Are my searches secure?
Searches go through Google. They are encrypted so that only you and Google can
read them. They're associated with whatever Google account you choose to use
when you create a key for Google's API. If you require complete anonymity, then
create a Google account that is not associated in any way with your actual
identity. Then use it only from public locations like libraries and coffee
shops, and only while wearing a mask; or use an anonymous VPN service such as 
[ProtonVPN][protonvpn] or [Tor][tor], which will conceal your location with
less trouble.  Lastly, when setting your base location, don't use your exact
actual location unless you're okay with Google knowing it.  Truncate your
coordinates to 10-kilometer precision if you like, or set a base location on
the other side of town; your search results won't be drastically affected.

Aerial views are accessed through [Gmap4][gmap4]. When you access the aerial
view of a location, your web browser will submit that location's MGRS
coordinate in an encrypted manner. Your base location and your search queries
are never shared with Gmap4. Depending on your network and the configuration of
your browser, it may be possible for Gmap4 to determine your actual location.
If this is a problem for you, then an anonymous VPN is once again recommended.
