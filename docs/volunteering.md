# What can you do to protect your community?
Communities face a variety of threats. Here are a few ways that you might be
able to help.

- Many rural communities have volunteer fire departments. They depend on
volunteers like you and me to protect the people from wildfires.

- Some sheriffs proactively establish a posse of vetted volunteers. The posse
trains with the officers on a regular basis and assists as needed with the
policing of the county.

- FEMA encourages and trains Community Emergency Response Teams (CERTs).

- Some amateur-radio groups, such as the Amateur Radio Emergency Service
(ARES), provide emergency communication services. They often coordinate with
other emergency services such as the American Red Cross.

- Volunteer search-and-rescue units, including Civil Air Patrol, provide a
critical service for lost hikers and other missing or injured people.

- Able-bodied citizens, as the militia of their community or state, have a duty
to be armed and well trained to defend it. This duty is reflected in the United
States Constitution, as well as in the constitutions of the vast majority of
U.S. states and in many federal and state laws.

These are just a few of the ways that you may be able to contribute to the
defense of your own community. Make your intentions and abilities known, and
I'm sure you can find some good way to help. Whatever your endeavor, you'd do
well to have good maps and useful overlays. Let [GridScout™][gridscout] help.

If you'd like to encourage the developers of GridScout™ and contribute to the
success of their endeavors, then there's no better way than to buy them some of
the stuff on [Jeremy's wish list][wish-list].
