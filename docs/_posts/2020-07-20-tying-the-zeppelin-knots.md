The zeppelin bend is a great knot for joining two ropes together. The zeppelin
loop is a great knot for making a fixed loop. This is how I tie them.

# Zeppelin bend

This bend won't slip or shake loose, ever. It reduces the breaking strength of
a rope by only 25%. And it remains easy to untie after being subjected to an
extreme load, although not _while_ loaded. To tie it:

1. Near the end of the first rope, make a turn around your hand.

2. Do the same with the second rope in the opposite direction, positioning the
rope ends at opposite ends of your hand.

3. Pass the end of one rope over the other rope, then through both ropes where
your hand is.

4. Do the same with the other rope.

5. Pull the standing parts, then pull the ends. Repeat till tight.

# Zeppelin loop

This loop is based on the zeppelin bend, so it shares the bend's excellent
qualities. To tie it:

1. Tie an overhand knot some distance from the end of the rope, then pass the
end around an object (optionally) and back through the far opening in the
overhand knot as illustrated.

2. Pass the end through the loop as illustrated.

3. Pass the end through the near opening in the overhand knot as illustrated
and under its own standing part.

4. Pull the standing part, then pull the end.
