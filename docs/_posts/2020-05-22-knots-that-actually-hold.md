title: Knots that actually hold

Some knots in common use have never been all that good. Others have grown less
secure as we've turned to synthetic ropes. These ropes are strong and resist
rotting, but they're a bit slippery. So we just can't keep depending on knots
that kinda sorta worked in the 19th century. Here's a list of loops, shanks,
bends, bindings, and hitches that'll actually hold in modern rope.

FYI, the worst offenders are the sheepshank, sheetbend, half-hitch, clove
hitch, and shoelace knot.

### Fixed loops

- **[Cossack loop.][cossack-loop]**
Use at the end of a rope in place of bowline loop. Favored by Russians and
Eskimos.

- **[Flemish loop.][flemish-loop]**
Use at the end of a rope or in the middle.  One of the fastest fixed loops to
tie and, with its figure-eight shape, the easiest to verify. A bit of a pain to
untie after stressing though.

- **[Alpine butterfly loop.][butterfly-loop]**
Use in place of Flemish loop in the middle of a rope, if ease of untying is
important.


### Shanks
- **Butterfly shank.**
Use alpine butterfly in place of sheepshank, which is the best known but most
unreliable of shanks, lest you die.

The point of a shank is to bypass a section of rope that is damaged or overly
long. A shank that easily shakes loose obviously won't do.

### Bends
- **[Simple-Simon-under bend.][simple-simon-under]**
Use in place of sheetbend for joining slippery or dissimilar ropes. About as
easy as the name suggests.
- **[Vice-versa bend.][vice-versa-bend]**
Use in place of sheetbend for joining stretchy rope.
- **Butterfly bend.**
Use alpine butterfly in place of sheetbend wherever ease of untying after
extreme stress is valued more than tidiness.
- **[Zeppelin bend.][zeppelin-bend]**
Use anywhere you'd use the butterfly bend, like when mooring blimps.

I tested the security of eight bends. Check out the [results][bend-test].

### Bindings
- **[Double constrictor knot.][double-constrictor]** The most manly of
bindings. Use in place of clove hitch or right-angle knot. The old-timers say
you have to cut it off; but with synthetic rope, untying is often perfectly
feasible.
- **Slipped double constrictor knot.** Use in place of clove hitch as a secure
but easily untied binding.

- **Double-throw reef knot.**
Variant [H2H2s][surgical-knot-study] of the surgeon's knot. Simply a reef
knot with its two halves converted to double overhand knots by an additional
pass through the center. Consider using in place of reef knot, especially
against a non-convex surface or in stretchy rope.
- **Reef knot in two bights.**
For a decorative shoelace bow that'll stay tied all day: first fold the ends
over to form bights, then simply tie them in a reef knot.

Most people use a standard shoelace knot (double-slipped reef), but it works
loose easily. The reef knot's grip seems to rely on its symmetry, and using
bights for only half of the knot disrupts that symmetry.

### Hitches

- **Double constrictor knot, or slipped variant.**
This binding serves well as a simple hitch.

- **[Steeplejack's knot.][steeplejacks-knot]**
A simple friction hitch that actually holds. Use in place of rolling hitch or
two half-hitches.

- **Safety-belt hitch.**
Consists of a steeplejack's knot tied around the standing part to form an
adjustable loop. Use in place of midshipman's hitch to tie down an aircraft, or
to tension a guyline.

- **Truckerâ€™s hitch (secure & adjustable variant).**
Use this compound knot to secure a load.
  1. Make a fixed upper loop with the alpine butterfly.
  2. Pass the end around an object to form a lower loop.
  3. With the remainder of the rope, tie a safety-belt hitch onto the upper loop.
  4. Adjust the safety-belt hitch to tighten the lower loop.
