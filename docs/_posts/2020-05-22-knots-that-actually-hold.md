Some knots in common use have never been all that good. Others have grown less
secure as we've turned to synthetic ropes. These ropes are strong and resist
rotting, but they're a bit slippery. So we just can't keep depending on knots
that kinda sorta worked in the 19th century. Here's a list of loops, shanks,
bends, bindings, and hitches that'll actually hold in modern rope.

FYI, the worst offenders are the sheepshank, sheetbend, half-hitch, clove
hitch, and shoelace knot.

### Loops
- **[Cossack loop.][cossack-loop]** Use at the end of a rope in place of
  bowline loop. Favored by Russians and Eskimos.
- **[Flemish loop.][flemish-loop]** Use at the end of a rope or in the middle.
  One of the fastest fixed loops to tie and, with its figure-eight shape, the
  easiest to verify. A bit of a pain to untie after stressing though.
- **[Alpine butterfly loop.][butterfly-loop]** Use in place of Flemish loop in
  the middle of a rope, if ease of untying is important.


### Shanks
- **Butterfly shank.** Use alpine butterfly in place of sheepshank, which is
  the best known but most unreliable of shanks, lest you die.

The point of a shank is to bypass a section of rope that is damaged or overly
long. A shank that easily shakes loose obviously won't do.

### Bends
- **[Simple-Simon-under bend.][simple-simon-under]** Use in place of sheetbend
  for joining slippery or dissimilar ropes. As easy as the name suggests.
- **[Vice-versa bend.][vice-versa-bend]** Use in place of sheetbend for
  joining stretchy rope.
- **Butterfly bend.** Use alpine butterfly in place of sheetbend wherever ease
  of untying after extreme stress is valued more than tidiness.
- **[Zeppelin bend.][zeppelin-bend]** Use anywhere you'd use the butterfly
  bend, like when mooring blimps.


### Bindings
- **[Double constrictor knot.][double-constrictor]** The most manly of
  bindings. Use in place of clove hitch or right-angle knot. The old-timers say
  you have to cut it off; but with synthetic rope, untying is perfectly
  feasible.
- **Slipped double constrictor knot.** Use in place of clove hitch as a secure
  but easily untied binding.

- **[Strangle knot.][strangle-knot]** Use in place of one or two half-hitches
  to lock any unfinished knot.
- **Double-throw reef knot.** Variant [H2H2s][surgical-knot-study] of the
  surgeon's knot. Simply a reef knot with its two halves converted to double
  overhand knots by an additional pass through the center. Consider using in
  place of reef knot, especially against a non-convex surface or in stretchy
  rope.
- **Double-throw shoelace knot.** For a secure quick-release bow, alter your
  shoelace knot (double-slipped reef knot) in the same manner. The result is an
  H2H2s with the final end tucks converted to bight tucks.
- **Reef knot in two bights.** For a semi-permanent bow, first fold the ends
  over to form bights, then tie a full reef knot entirely in those bights.

I fasten my pajama pants with a double-throw shoelace knot and my running shoes
with a reef knot in two bights. Most people use a standard shoelace knot, but
it works loose.

### Hitches
- **Double constrictor knot, or slipped variant.** This binding serves well as
  a simple hitch.
- **Truckerâ€™s hitch (fixed-loop variant, well locked).**
  Everybody ties this differently, but here's the method that I trust. Make a
  fixed upper loop (e.g. alpine butterfly). Pass the end around an object and
  back through the upper loop. Tighten lower loop by pulling end back toward the
  object, then clamp the end to the lower loop with a half-hitch.  Lock that half
  hitch with a secure binding (e.g. strangle knot).
