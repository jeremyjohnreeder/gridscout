"A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the
right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."

â€” Constitution of the United States, 2nd Amendment

We the People are responsible for our own security and for that of our
communities. That responsibility cannot reasonably be delegated to any
government. I have two reasons for this position:

1. *It is infeasible for a government to provide adequate security to respond
to immediate threats against each individual.* The best it can do is to
prioritize whom to protect, and governments generally acknowledge this
limitation. Forgive me if I'm uncomfortable with the notion of allowing my
family and others around me to be deemed expendable when I myself am capable of
providing security.

2. *It is highly dangerous to the People when their government is allowed to
entertain notions of superiority over them, of a monopoly on the right to
certain property, and of the right to forcibly establish such a monopoly.* Such
an abolishment of freedom, applied to weapons, will inevitably lead to more
massacres and other atrocities. Whether these future attacks are perpetrated by
private entities or by the government itself, they pose a serious threat.

So let's keep our security. Let's remain free. Let's not subject ourselves to
violent attacks or to unjust rule which puts are lives in jeopardy. Let's not
ever give up our rightful defenses, no matter how nicely our leaders may try to
paint that picture.
