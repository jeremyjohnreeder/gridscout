### Experiment

I've been wondering about the relative security of various bend knots. By this
I mean how much force each knot can take before coming untied. So I did a
little experiment with eight bends tied in greased fishing line.

A related measure is how much each knot reduces the breaking strength of the
ropes in which it is tied. That's not what I'm trying to measure here. That's
why I chose a material that's intentionally super slippery, hoping that in most
cases I'd reach the security limit before I reach the strength limit. But alas,
some knots just won't slip.


### Results

| Bend Knot              | Limit (g) | Failure |
|------------------------|-----------|---------|
| Butterfly Bend         | 3056      | Break   |
| Simple Simon Under     | 2721      | Break   |
| Simple Simon Crossover | 2214      | Slip    |
| Simple Simon Over      | 1982      | Slip    |
| Simple Simon Double    | 1933      | Break   |
| Zeppelin Bend          | 1827      | Break   |
| Sheetbend              | 1089      | Slip    |
| Double Sheetbend       | 891       | Slip    |


### Conclusions

I like the butterfly bend and find it easy to tie, so I'm happy to learn that
it holds so well. I'm surprised that the zeppelin did so much worse. I find it
a bit harder to tie and less versatile, so I may stop bothering with it.

The Simple-Simon-crossover bend is my own invention. In this test it outperformed all but one of Harry Asher's Simple-Simon knots. Since it's also the easiest Simple-Simon to tie,
this is pretty satisfying. I had hoped, though, that it would equal the security of the Simple-Simon-under. Not quite. Surprisingly, Asher's Simple-Simon-double seems have substantially reduced the breaking strength, making it the worst performer of the series.

As expected, the sheetbend and double sheetbend slipped way too easily to be
worth using. What's surprising is that the double sheetbend actually did the
worst of these two.
