Inspired by [naval demolition trainees tying knots][underwater-test] —albeit
inferior ones— underwater, and also by firefighters doing it in thick fireproof
gloves, I present to you the GridScout™ knot challenge!


### Challenge

Darkness is to most of us a more practical obstacle. So, in a completely dark
room or with your vision of the rope otherwise completely obstructed, correctly
tie each of the following knots.


1. **[Double constrictor knot][double-constrictor]**

In lieu of the inferior clove hitch or right-angle knot.
{:.tangent}


2. **[Simple-Simon-crossover bend][simple-simon-crossover]**

[172% more secure][bend-comparison] than the sheetbend.
{:.tangent}


3. **[Alpine butterfly][butterfly-loop] (ABoK #331)**

Excellent as a mid-rope loop, as a shank, or as a bend.
{:.tangent}


4. **[Zeppelin loop][zeppelin-loop]**

A fixed loop for the end of a rope, better than the bowline in every way.
{:.tangent}


5. **[Sub-lieutenant's hitch][sublieutenants-hitch]**

A secure adjustable loop, preferred over the midshipman's hitch.
{:.tangent}
