Bungee line and other super stretchy cordage can't be fastened securely with
most traditional knots. Here are a few knots that work exceptionally well in
bungee.

### Fixed loops

- **[Angler's loop.][anglers-loop]**
Tie this for a permanent loop.


### Bends

- **[Vice-versa bend.][vice-versa-bend]**
Use for joining two bungee lines. The ends are tidily parallel to the standing
parts, convenient if you have to reeve the knot through an eye. Fairly
difficult to untie after heavily loading.

- **[Zeppelin bend.][zeppelin-bend]**
Use in place of the vice-versa bend wherever ease of untying after extreme
stress is valued more than tidiness.
