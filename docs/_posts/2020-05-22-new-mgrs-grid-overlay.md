Since Google put [Gmap4™ out of business][gmap4-rip], we've been lacking an MGRS
grid on our aerial views. But as of today, [GridScout Map™][gridscout] now uses
[GISsurfer™][gis-surfer], making it easier to correlate points on these
photographs with those on our paper maps.


[gis-surfer]: https://gissurfer.com

[gridscout]:  /
