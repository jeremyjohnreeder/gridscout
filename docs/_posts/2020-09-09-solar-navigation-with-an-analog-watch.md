You probably already know some basic solar navigation:
- The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
- The sun is directly south at noon.

But these are only rough approximations of the truth. And they can be plenty
misleading, so let's just call them LIES. Here I present _actual_ truths about
the position of the sun and a sometimes better way to find directions. No
equipment necessary except an analog watch.

### Lie #1: The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.

At my home near the 43<sup>rd</sup> parallel, trusting that the sun rises in
the east can mislead a fella by up to 34° in winter and summer. It's even less
accurate at higher latitudes. Here's the truth:

The sun rises approximately in the east and sets approximately in the west.
Twice a year, at the equinoxes, any deviation from due east and due west is
negligible.  But the sun deviates northward in both rising and setting as we
approach the June solstice.  And it deviates southward as we approach the
December solstice.  At each solstice you'll get at least 25° of deviation,
depending on your latitude.  Inside the polar circles, the sun won't actually
rise or set at all, it'll only circle around you just above or below the
horizon.

### Lie #2: The sun is directly south at noon.

Yeah, okay, but when is noon? Do you trust the government to tell you? They may
mislead you by an hour or two. Local solar noon may not come at 12:00 civil
time. It varies with your longitudinal position within the time zone, and
daylight saving time moves it an hour clockwise. Today my solar noon is at
1:42pm.

Don't forget, of course, that in parts of the world the sun is _north_ at solar
noon. And in the tropics, it alternates.

## How 'bout a reverse sundial?

The hour hand of an analog watch follows the apparent path of the sun pretty
closely at moderate to high latitudes. So when the sun is visible and you're at
least 20° of latitude away from the sun's path, it comes in pretty handy as a
compass.

### Navigating with a 12-hour dial
- When you're north of the sun's path and the hour hand of a 12-hour watch dial on a horizontal plane is pointed at the sun, south is about halfway between it and the dial's solar noon position.
- When you're south of the sun's path and the solar noon position on a 12-hour watch dial is pointed at the sun, north is about halfway between it and the hour hand.
- When the sun is high in the sky, it helps to hold a small pole (such as a pen) vertically next to your watch and align the hour hand with its shadow.
- NOTE: Navigation is easier with a _24-hour_ dial.

If you're not sure when your local solar noon is, then calculate it or look it
up. Or at least, for crying out loud, don't use the 12:00 position during
daylight saving time! Instead, use 1:00 in summertime to compensate for DST.

### Navigating with a 24-hour dial
- When you're north of the sun's path and the hour hand of a 24-hour watch dial on a horizontal plane is pointed at the sun, the dial's solar noon position points approximately southward.
- When you're south of the sun's path and the solar noon position of a 24-hour watch dial on a horizontal plane is pointed at the sun, the hour hand points approximately northward.
- The hour hand on a 24-hour dial revolves only once per day, matching the sun. Hence these simplified methods that don't require bisection of angles.
- These methods are easiest with daytime at the top of the dial and nighttime at the bottom, as is common in Russian military watches.

### How accurate is watch-based navigation?

It's best for summertime polar expeditions, but it can be plenty useful
elsewhere as well. Any directional error produced by using your watch as a
reverse sundial is minimal at intervals of 6 hours from solar noon. The error
peaks, however, at odd multiples of 3 hours. The magnitude of those peaks
depends on how close you are to the sun's path, as shown in the following
table.

\* Solar latitudes refer to distance from the sun's path, not from the equator.
Your solar latitude at the summer solstice is 23° less than your equatorial
latitude, making your reverse sundial less accurate. Your solar latitude at the
winter solstice is likewise 23° greater than your equatorial latitude, making
it _more_ accurate.
{:.tangent}

\** Earth's orbit is slightly elliptical, so the sun's apparent movement varies
by up to 4° from what you'd see with a perfectly round orbit.

These calculations come from the [North American Sundial
Society][calculations], but of course I've repurposed them.
