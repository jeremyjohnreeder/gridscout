You probably already know some basic solar navigation:
- The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
- The sun is directly south at noon.

But these are only rough approximations of the truth. And they can be plenty
misleading, so let's just call them lies. Here I present _actual_ truths about
the position of the sun and a better way to find directions. No equipment
necessary except an analog watch.

### Lie #1: The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.

At my home near the 43<sup>rd</sup> parallel, trusting that the sun rises in the east can
mislead a fella by up to 34° in winter and summer. It's even less
accurate at higher latitudes. Here's the truth:

The sun rises approximately in the east and sets approximately in the west.
Twice a year, at the equinoxes, any deviation from due east and due west is negligible.
But the sun deviates northward in both rising and setting as we approach the June solstice.
And it deviates southward as we approach the December solstice.
At each solstice you'll get at least 25° of deviation, depending on your latitude.
Inside the polar circles, the sun won't actually rise or set at all, it'll only circle around you just above or below the horizon.

### Lie #2: The sun is directly south at noon.

Yeah, okay, but when is noon? Do you trust the government to tell you? They may
mislead you by an hour or two. Local solar noon may not come at 12:00 civil
time. It varies with your longitudinal position within the time zone, and
daylight saving time moves it an hour clockwise. Today my solar noon is at
1:42pm.

Don't forget, of course, that in parts of the world the sun is _north_ at
solar noon. And in the tropics, it alternates.

## Analog watch as navigational aid

When the sun is visible and you're at least a few degrees of latitude away from
the sun's path, the hour hand of an analog watch comes in handy as a compass.
It follows the actual path of the sun pretty closely, producing no more than a
third of the error given by trusting that the sun rises in the east. Maximum error seems to be about 12°.

[Rob Bicevskis][bicevskis-dissent] argues that the accuracy of these methods varies substantially from hour to hour. I'm investigating his claims and will experiment further.

### Navigating with a 12-hour dial
- When you're north of the sun's path and the hour hand of a 12-hour watch dial on a horizontal plane is pointed at the sun, south is halfway between it and the dial's local solar noon position.
- When you're south of the sun's path and the local solar noon position on a 12-hour watch dial is pointed at the sun, north is halfway between it and the hour hand.
- When the sun is high in the sky, it helps to hold a small pole (such as a pen) vertically next to your watch and align the hour hand with its shadow.
- NOTE: Navigation is easier with a _24-hour_ dial.

If you're not sure when your local solar noon is, then look it up. Or at least, for crying out loud, don't use the 12:00 position during daylight saving time! Use 1:00 in summertime to compensate for DST.

### Navigating with a 24-hour dial
- When you're north of the sun's path and the hour hand of a 24-hour watch dial on a horizontal plane is pointed at the sun, the dial's local solar noon position points approximately southward.
- When you're south of the sun's path and the local solar noon position of a 24-hour watch dial on a horizontal plane is pointed at the sun, the hour hand points approximately northward.
- The hour hand on a 24-hour dial revolves only once per day, matching the sun. Hence these simplified methods that don't require bisection of angles.
- These methods are easiest with daytime at the top of the dial and nighttime at the bottom, as is common in Russian military watches.
