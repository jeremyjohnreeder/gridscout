TL;DR -- A Russian-style 24-hour watch, aligned with the equatorial plane,
makes a fantastic solar compass.

You probably already know some basic solar-navigation concepts, but these are
only rough approximations of the truth.
- The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
- The sun is directly south at noon.

These approximations can be plenty misleading, so let's just call them LIES.
Here I present _actual_ truths about the position of the sun and a far better
way to use it to find directions. No equipment necessary except an analog
watch and a pocket knife.

### Lie #1: The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.

At my home near the 43<sup>rd</sup> parallel, trusting that the sun rises in
the east can mislead a fella by up to 34° in winter and summer. It's even less
accurate at higher latitudes. Here's how it _actually_ works:

The sun rises approximately in the east and sets approximately in the west.
Twice a year, at the equinoxes, any deviation from due east and due west is
negligible. But the sun deviates northward in both rising and setting as we
approach the June solstice.  And it deviates southward as we approach the
December solstice.  At each solstice you'll get at least 25° of deviation,
depending on your latitude.  Inside the polar circles, the sun won't actually
rise or set at all, it'll only circle around you just above or below the
horizon.

### Lie #2: The sun is directly south at noon.

Yeah, okay, but when is noon? Do you trust the government to tell you? They may
mislead you by an hour or more. Local solar noon may not come at 12:00 civil
time. It varies with your longitudinal position within the time zone, and
daylight saving time moves it an hour clockwise. Today my solar noon is at
13:42.

Don't forget, of course, that in parts of the world the sun is _north_ at solar
noon. And in the tropics, it alternates.

## True directions with a reverse sundial

Now that we've got those directional _lies_ out of the way, let's discuss how
to find the _truth_. The hour hand of a 24-hour analog watch follows the
apparent path of the sun very well, so it comes in pretty handy as a compass.
With a little trickery, even a 12-hour watch will do.

But first you'll have to identify your local solar noon. Calculate it or look
it up. Use 12:00 as a rough approximation _if you must_, or 13:00 during
daylight saving time.

Next, you'll set up your watch as a _reverse equatorial sundial_ and pivot your
body till the sundial reads the correct time. When it does, you'll know which
direction you're facing because a sundial only reads the correct time when it's
facing the direction that it's calibrated for. Whereas sundials are usually
pointed in the proper direction and then used to determine the current time,
they work equally well in reverse.

Read on to find out exactly _how_ to navigate with just an analog watch and a
pocket knife.

### Navigating with a 24-hour dial

Navigation is easiest with daytime at the top of the dial and nighttime at the
bottom, as is common in Russian military watches. This arrangement generally
allows you to navigate without removing the watch from your wrist.

#### (when north of the sun's path or directly on it)
1. Position the watch dial vertically with the solar noon position at the top.
2. Tilt the dial away from you by an angle equal to your latitude.
3. Rotate your body till the hour hand points toward the sun.<sup>a</sup>
4. The dial's solar noon position now points southward<sup>b</sup>.

<sup>a</sup> If the sun is north of the equator, you can use a knife blade to
cast a shadow on the hour hand as an alignment guide. Otherwise, it may be
helpful as an extension of the hour hand.
{:.tangent .indent}

<sup>b</sup> In the tropics, the sun may pass directly overhead at solar noon.
If it does, all directions will seem to be south. Wait ten minutes.
{:.tangent .indent}

#### (when south of the sun's path)
1. Position the watch dial vertically with the hour hand at the top.
2. Tilt the dial away from you by an angle equal to your latitude.
3. Rotate your body till the solar noon position points toward the sun.<sup>c</sup>
4. The hour hand now points southward.

<sup>c</sup> When the sun is south of the equator, you can use a knife blade to
cast a shadow on the solar-noon position as an alignment guide. Otherwise, it
may be helpful as an extended marker of solar noon.
{:.tangent .indent}

### Navigating with a 12-hour dial

Remember, it's easier with a _24-hour_ dial. If you dislike bisecting angles or
need an excuse to go watch-shopping, keep that in mind. But 12-hour watches are
more common, so here's how it's done.

#### (when north of the sun's path or directly on it)
1. Position the watch dial vertically with the solar noon position at the top.
2. Tilt the dial away from you by an angle equal to your latitude.
3. Rotate your body till the sun is halfway between the hour hand and solar noon.<sup>d</sup>
4. The dial's solar noon position now points southward<sup>b</sup>.

<sup>d</sup> When the sun is north of the equator, you can use a knife blade to
cast a shadow on the dial as an alignment guide. Otherwise, it may be helpful
as an extended marker of the halfway point.
{:.tangent .indent}

#### (when south of the sun's path)
1. Position the watch dial vertically with the position halfway between the hour hand and solar noon is at the top.
2. Tilt the dial away from you by an angle equal to your latitude.
3. Rotate your body till the solar-noon position points toward the sun.<sup>c</sup>
4. The top of the dial now points northward.

### How accurate is watch-based navigation?

Almost perfectly accurate in theory, and plenty accurate in practice. The
accuracy of this _reverse equatorial sundial_ depends primarily on your
identification of local solar noon and on the alignment of your watch dial with
the equatorial plane.

#### Solar-noon error

If _civil time_ at any place on Earth were defined as the _solar time_ at the
nearest of 24 equally spaced meridians, then it could be trusted to be within
30 minutes, or 7½°, of correct.  But in reality our time zones have irregular
borders and are often made worse in the warmer months by daylight saving time.
So civil time can easily be off by two hours, sometimes more.

It's worth finding out when your local solar noon is. It varies a bit over the
seasons due to Earth's elliptic orbit, so you may want to just remember what
time it comes on Christmas Eve<sup>d</sup>. That'll get you within 16 minutes,
or 4°.

<sup>d</sup> The time that you're looking for is your _solar MEAN noon_. Your
_actual_ solar noon will occur at this time on April 15, June 15, September 1,
and December 24.
{:.tangent}

#### Equatorial-alignment error

For accurate readings the dial should be parallel to the plane at the equator
which bisects Earth into its two hemispheres. Holding your watch
horizontally<sup>e</sup> like an amateur can add up to 45° of error at the
edges of the tropics, or 21° in northern USA.<sup>f</sup> But if you can hold
it within 9° of proper alignment, a goal easily met by eyeball, then your
maximum directional error due to equatorial misalignment shrinks to just 3°.

<sup>e</sup> Other instruction on navigating with a watch assumes that equally
spaced markings are suitable for a _horizontal_ sundial. I'm right and [they're
wrong][bicevskis-error].
{:.tangent}

<sup>f</sup> These errors peak on the summer solstice, eastward three hours
before solar noon and westward three hours after.

### Where to, then?

Although useful anywhere with sun, watch-based navigation is _particularly_
well suited for a summertime polar expedition. The sun is up all day, the
equatorial plane is conveniently near horizontal, and the sun is on the right
side of it to cast a knife-blade shadow on your dial. Handy, since magnetic
compasses are [useless][compass-failure] inside the polar circles.
