Today we commemorate the [Battles of Lexington and Concord][battles], and the
brave minutemen who died there in our defense 244 years ago. In their memory,
the Real 3%ers of Idaho held a patriotic ceremony on the Capitol steps. Lt Gov.
Janice McGeachin, as acting governor, administered to all modern-day minutemen
in attendance an [oath][oath] of Constitutional allegiance.
