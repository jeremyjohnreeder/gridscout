#Building the RC1 — a lightweight modular carbine
The ultimate purpose of the GridScout™ map-search tool is to provide for a
better community defense. For that same purpose, I'm building a new rifle. I
call it the RC1. Why RC1? Because it's easier to explain that RC1 stands for
Reeder Carbine #1 than to explain that KP6 stands for _Piŝta Karabeno je 6,5
Grendel_.

#Firearm design
My intent is to create a weapon that is well suited for all ranges from 0 to
300 yards and easy to operate in close quarters. The barrel will be just long
enough to avoid the red tape of a short-barreled rifle. This length also serves
to keep the muzzle velocity high enough for medium-range use. The muzzle brake
will be a short, single-chamber model that minimizes the added weight and
length.

The RC1 will have a very short, fixed-length buttstock. This would make it
uncomfortable with the standard 33° grip angle, so its pistol grip will instead
be nearly vertical. This will place the wrist of the shooter's dominant hand in
a neutral position, while short length of pull will put the entire mass of the
RC1 closer to the shooter's body where he can more easily support it. The gun
is intended to be as lightweight as practical in order to further limit muscle
fatigue, as even minor fatigue can affect the steadiness with which the shooter
can hold his gun.

The RC1 will be based largely on the Alexander 6.5 Grendel Incursion, which is
relatively light and fires the most effective general-purpose cartridge yet
devised for the AR-15. It'll differ from the Incursion model in two important
ways.
- The RC1 will have a gas piston based on the ArmaLite AR-180 design, which has
  proven substantially more reliable than direct gas impingement.
- Other part selections are inspired by various ultralight models derived from
  the Colt AR15A3, as well as by PDWs.

#Sneak preview
When completed, the RC1 will look something like this. Here, a few paper parts
are standing in for the actual parts that I have not yet acquired. With a scope
and a full magazine, I anticipate a total weight of about 6.8 pounds.
