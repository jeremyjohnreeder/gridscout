A few months ago, [Google put the non-profit Gmap4 service out of
business][gmap4-rip]. [GridScout™][gridscout] relied on Gmap4 for its aerial
views, so that was a sad day. But yesterday I reënabled the aerial-view feature
using Google Maps directly. It lacks the MGRS-grid overlay that we used to
enjoy with Gmap4, but it's still useful for confirming the relevance of a
search result and checking its surroundings.
