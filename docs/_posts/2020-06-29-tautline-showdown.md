Friction-loop knots, several of which go by the name _taut-line_, are
adjustable loops commonly used to make guy-lines easily tensioned. They're handy
when you need to support a tent or hammock, tie an aircraft down, or fix a
telescope in orbit. You know, everyday stuff.

But there are several variants. Which friction loop works best? I tested eight
of them in parachute cord, and here are the results.

I used no special equipment. Just hands and feet and rope. To compare the grip
of two knots, I simply tied both in one rope to equal tightess and then pulled
to see which would slip first. Simplicity scores are inversely related to
length of rope required.

The most common friction loops are the midshipman's hitch (for sailors), the
rolling taut-line hitch (for landlubbers), and the magnus taut-line hitch (for
pilots). The "+1" taut-line variants have an extra turn before the finishing
half-hitch.

### Winner: CAWLEY HITCH!

The [Cawley hitch][cawley-hitch] seems to be the most practical of these
friction loops. It's one of the easiest to tie and uses the shortest amount of
rope. It's the easiest to tighten to the point where it grips well and gives
confidence that it won't shake loose. And it seems to be impossible to
overtighten this knot to the point where it becomes hard to adjust the tension
of the rope.

When people ask me the best way to make an apple pie, I say make it with
peaches. Okay, nobody asks me that. But when they ask the best way to tie a
taut-line, a more likely scenario, I'll tell them to tie a Cawley hitch
instead.
