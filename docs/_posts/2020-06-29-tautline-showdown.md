Friction-loop knots, several of which go by the name _taut-line_, are
adjustable loops commonly used to make guy-lines easily adjusted. They're handy
when you need to support a tent or hammock, tie an aircraft down, or fix a
telescope in orbit.

But there are several variants. Which friction loop works best? I tested eight
such knots by repeatedly tying loops in the ends of a parachute cord and noting
which end slipped first.

### Spotlight: Cawley hitch

Also known as the _adjustable-grip hitch_, the [Cawley hitch][cawley-hitch]
seems to be the most practical of the tested friction loops. It's one of the
easiest to tie and uses the shortest amount of rope. It's the easiest to
tighten to the point where it grips well and gives confidence that it won't
shake loose. And it seems to be impossible to overtighten this knot to the
point where it becomes hard to adjust the tension of the rope.

If anybody asks the best way to make an apple pie, I say make it with peaches.
And if anybody asks the best way to tie a taut-line, I say tie a Cawley hitch
instead.
