Friction-loop knots, several of which go by the name _taut-line_, are
adjustable loops commonly used to make guy-lines easily adjusted. They're handy
when you need to support a tent or hammock, tie an aircraft down, or fix a
telescope in orbit. You know, everday stuff.

But there are several variants. Which friction loop works best? I tested eight
of them in parachute cord, and here are the results.

I used no special equipment. Just hands and feet and rope. To
compare security of two knots, I simply tied both in one rope and pulled to
see which would slip first. Simplicity measures are subjective.

### Winner: Cawley hitch

Also known as the _adjustable-grip hitch_, the [Cawley hitch][cawley-hitch]
seems to be the most practical of the tested friction loops. It's one of the
easiest to tie and uses the shortest amount of rope. It's the easiest to
tighten to the point where it grips well and gives confidence that it won't
shake loose. And it seems to be impossible to overtighten this knot to the
point where it becomes hard to adjust the tension of the rope.

If anybody asks the best way to make an apple pie, I say make it with peaches.
And if anybody asks the best way to tie a taut-line, I'll tell him to tie a
Cawley hitch instead.
