A "bend" is a knot for joining two ropes together. Thinking that it would be
helpful to know which bends do this job best, I took several pieces of my
daughter's fishing line and did a little experiment.

### Experiment

In each line I tied a different bend, which I greased before pulling it tight.
I then hung the resulting loop on a hook and suspended a canvas bag from it. I filled
the bag with rocks till the fishing line either broke or slipped to a
completely untied state. I then repeated the experiment and recorded the average mass of the bag of rocks that had caused the knot to fail.

I was most interested in measuring the "security", or resistance to slipping,
as opposed to breaking strength. That's why I chose slippery material and made
it even slipperier, hoping that each bend would slip before having a chance to
break. But alas, some knots just won't slip.


### Results

| Bend knot                                        | Security (kg of rocks) |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| [Butterfly bend][butterfly-bend]                 | 5.4+                   |
| [Zeppelin bend][zeppelin-bend]                   | 5.4+                   |
| [Simple-Simon double][simple-simon-double]       | 5.4+                   |
| [Simple-Simon under][simple-simon-under]         | 5.4+                   |
| [Simple-Simon crossover][simple-simon-crossover] | 4.9                    |
| [Simple-Simon over][simple-simon-over]           | 4.0                    |
| [Double sheetbend][sheetbend-double]             | 3.3                    |
| [Sheetbend][sheetbend]                           | 1.8                    |

The '+' symbol indicates that the knot's slip limit, even tied in grease,
exceeds the breaking strength of the line in which it was tested.

### Conclusions

I love the alpine butterfly as a bend, a shank, and a loop. It's versatile and
easy to tie, so I'm happy to confirm that it refuses to slip.

The Simple-Simon-crossover bend is my own creation. In this test it
outperformed the Simple-Simon-over, on which it is based, by 23%. Since it's no
harder to tie, this is a satisfying discovery. As I hoped, it seems to be more secure against slippage of the bight (in the first line) around which the second line is tied. Its resistance to slippage of the second line, however, is unimproved by this variation, leaving its overall security a bit inferior to that of the Simple-Simon-under when used to join two identical lines. Results may differ greatly when the two lines differ.

The classic sheetbend and double sheetbend are the least secure of all bends tested.
The former slips so easily in comparison that its use is hard to justify.


### Simple-Simon-crossover bend
{:#simple-simon-crossover}

This new knot is a variant of the Simple-Simon-over bend. The only difference
is that the standing part and the working end of the first rope are swapped.
The second rope is tied around a bight in that first rope just as usual.
Uniquely among the Simple-Simon knots, the rope ends are ultimately diagonal
from each other.

The result is that the bight of the first rope is clamped just as in the
_Simple-Simon-under_ bend without the relative difficulty of making a pass
_under_ the rope. The intention is that this new knot will serve as a
substantial security upgrade to the easiest Simple-Simon knot, the
Simple-Simon-over, at no cost at all in required effort.

WARNING: Despite this success, under a certain circumstance, I've found that the _Simple-Simon-under_ and the _Simple-Simon-double_ are far better choices. That is, when tying a skinny line around the bight of a soft, fat one.
